/*
This JavaScript file demonstrates various types of functions in JavaScript, including regular, function expression, arrow function, and named function expressions.

Function Types:
- Regular Function: This is a function declared using the "function" keyword.
- Function Expression: This is a function created using the "function" keyword, but assigned to a variable.
- Arrow Function: This is a concise way to write function expressions. It does not have a "function" keyword.
- Named Function Expression: This is a function expression with a name. It is useful when debugging or for recursion.
- Generator Function: This is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed at will.
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): This is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

Function Usage:
- Calling Functions: Invoke the functions using their names or variables.
- Returning Values: Use the "return" keyword to return a value from a function.
- Recursion: Use a function to call itself. This is useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller parts.
